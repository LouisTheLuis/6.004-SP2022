1. Assuming every instruction takes the same amount of time, what percentage of time
does your code spend in partition? If you wanted to improve the performance of your
code, which portion would you look at first?

As we have 122380 instructions for <partition> and 147065 instructions for the entire
code, we will have that <partition> would roughly take 83.21% of the time of the 
code. Thus, if I wanted to improve the performance I would first look at the 
implementation of <sort>; more specifically, at the implementation of its loop and
assignment of array values in memory.
